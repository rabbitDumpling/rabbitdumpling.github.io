It was another 2 years after Final Fantasy II, Japan got an exclusive close to their first trilogy of games: Final Fantasy III. Released on the Famicom, the rest of the world would never see the original release of this game outside of fan translation projects. It wouldn't be until 2006 that anyone outside Japan would be able to enjoy an official version of the game: the remade DS version. While I had played translations of the original version, I didn't truly sit down with the game until the DS version. I got only so far before the forced social networking kept me from unlocking things and I get extremely annoyed with it. Now we will be enjoying the PC port of that edition on Steam, which replaced the social media with monster hunting!

> The Gulgan thus prophesied: "The earthquake was only the beginning. The great tremors that swallowed the crystals, the light of our world, only to spawn monsters from the depths of the scarred land, are nothing but harbingers of what has yet to come. Something is coming...fathomless, ominous, and full of sorrow... But hope is not yet lost. Four souls will be blessed with light, and so it shall begin...

I remember that my first attempts were done after playing other games with job system mechanics, and I was immediately disappointed by the lack of customization. I always felt it made the most sense for characters to learn things from their jobs and retain that knowledge after changing then.

The difficulty of the original was also odd to me because I remember beating the first boss pretty easily, but then finding it hard to progress from there? But my memory may be more fuzzy than usual since this was during my early days of adventuring into emulation and I tried to play so many games.

I remember the DS version fondly, so my expectations are fro a fun adventure playing adorable dress-up with my ragtag team of heroes. Now that I know not to expect a lot of customization, I figure this is more about party balance and potentially assigning each member of the team a general role they will always fill. I don't remember much of the plot **at all** so I don't know what to expect there. All in all, I hope to have a good time.

As I mentioned, there are optional side quests you can embark on that are usually unlocked by sending enough social media to other game owners. In the steam version, this has been changed (or so I am informed) to the current bestiary percentage discovered. A much more sensible decision, despite there apparently being completely missable entries. I do plan on finishing these quests in order to unlock, *what can become*, the most powerful class.

To say I've had my fair share of issues in this endeavor would be putting it *lightly*. I've fallen behind on posting reviews but as far as the game timeline we are officially ahead of schedule and are moving on to Final Fantasy IV in March! The reason for that is *quite* complicated, and I will get into that during the reviews.

### Final Fantasy II (After)

Final Fantasy II has a pretty grand plot compared to its predecessor. Where Final Fantasy had a tale of four destined heroes, in the second chapter of the franchise we have four orphans, one lost at the get-go, and the other three struggling to reclaim their home from an oppressive regime, not divinely chosen by the universe, but merely in the path of heroics as they put together their broken livesâ€”or so I observed from our adventure since I only made it to the beginning of the third (of thirteen) chapters.

Unfortunately, thanks to hardware issues, we were forced to cut the playthrough short. Every time we attempted to make our way forward, the game would freeze and crash, and would sometimes even revert the battery save to an earlier version that had already been saved over? it was a bizarre circumstance to be sure of.

As far as the skill system present in the game, it wasn't as annoying as expected. Honestly, the variability in my party was welcome, and truth be told I found the addition of the fourth party member ended up being a crutch as well as a nuisance. Minwu's healing was welcome but knowing his presence wasn't permanent immediately caused me to not care about his development. I think a permanent party of four would have been nicer. Also while leveling up weapons and spells is intuitive, stats were a bit trickier. Afterall, Barraging myself with low-level spells isn't exactly an intended strategy I'm sure.

My final word based on what I got to play is that Final Fantasy II is one of the two black sheep games of the franchise, and I don't see why aside from the fact that it departed from the series norms, that didn't exist when it came out mind you and tried to be new. Many early franchises have their sequel as a black sheep for this exact reason, because looking back at 15+ games, Final Fantasy II was "too different". It's a fun game, and worth the time.

### Final Fantasy III (After)

You have been chosen by destiny, as an orphan in a small town, obviously it is your destiny to save the world. And with your three orphan pals no less! Okay, I should cut Final Fantasy III some slack. Picking up the reins from Final Fantasy, it brings back the four elemental crystals as a plot device. This time, they have been turned toward darkness, and the universe seeks to make this right by appointing four children as the warrior of the light, made to reset the cosmic balance. And so our heroes start fixing everyone's problems and restoring balance to the world. Unlike Final Fantasy II, we got quite far into this one, having just started the ninth chapter, which is about halfway through the game.

This time the issue was a software one. In order to ease the eyes of the audience, I made use of a visual mod that cleaned up the menus to appear more like a traditional final Fantasy UI (as opposed to one designed for a touch screen). I also opted for a balancing patch to make life easier and to avoid the excessive grinding Final Fantasy III is known for. On February 27th, 2020, Square decided to release a patch (and patch is a strong word for it) to attempt to do the same things mine did. Only it does not work, it is horribly broken, and apparently crashes the game whenever I open the Job menu. Thanks for that Square.

So when it comes to mechanics, I will be honest, Final Fantasy 3 fell a little flat. A lack of customization in characters in exchange for customizing the party lends itself to a very limiting factor: Job Levels. Since in this game your characters base stats are affected by their current Job, there is a significant detriment to dragging a character back to a Level 1 Job. This means while the option to plan your own set of four Jobs is there, sometimes it isn't practical if it means having a character start a new Job from scratch. This does mean that choosing each member of the party to specialize in either specific styles of Job (i.e., physical, magical or specialized) is likely a good idea, but you can expect to grind a bit between dungeons as you bring your new party up to speed.

The final verdict for Final Fantasy III is that it set-up the ball for Final Fantasy V, which spiked it into the win zone. You can't blame the prototype for its faults by comparing it to the final product. From what I played, I did enjoy myself, despite the necessary Job grinding.

So, before we dive in, I want to preface this with something. For each game I play, I will be putting up two posts in particular: one before and one after (not to say I won't be posting in between if something comes up). The post before will focus on goals, expectations and past experiences with the game. The post after will have a review, maybe some highlights as well as links to the archived VODs over on my YouTube channel. So with that said, let's begin...

> "And so their journey began. The four Warriors of Light felt overwhelmed by the great task destiny had placed upon them. They did not know the true significance of the four crystals they held in their hands... The crystal that once, long ago, shone with a light so brilliant. The time for their journey had come. The time to cast off the veil of darkness and bring the world once more into the light..."

Final Fantasy 1, originally released in 1987, although the English-speaking market wouldn't see it until 1990 (well most of the English-speaking market). I first played it as a child when I visited the U.S. for the first time on the NES and I'm gonna go ahead and say that it was not great. I never left Corneria (the first town of the game) because I didn't quite understand fighting, and the monster sprites kinda scared me. I was very young. Also, I believe I ran an FT/FT/FT/FT party.

My next attempt was on an old blog I ran where we featured *Screenshot Lets Plays.* This old blog, now dead, opened with a similar project to play the, then, Final Fantasy franchise to its fullest. This time I ran **Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls** on the GBA. This was a run with a team of FT/BB/RM/BM. They were named Dune, Spud, Jojo, and Leo, after the characters as featured in [Duane & BrandO's Final Fantasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzZfMSkdvFk) (warnings for the strong language). This team made is as far as Matoya's Cave before my computer died and pushed me into an editorial role on the blog for a while.

So what party will I go with this time? While I was considering reviving the D&B Team, I've decided to leave my fate in the hands of my twitter followers, so feel free to vote on that (if this poll is still active).

Final Fantasy Origin has a pretty simple 100% requirement: open all chests, defeat all enemies and fill the bestiary, unlock all secret artwork. Honestly, this wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't that last one. To unlock the secret artwork, the game has to be completed twice: on easy and on normal. That isn't happening, so I'm not going to worry about it. Final Fantasy doesn't have side quests as far as I know so I don't think there is anything else left.

My expectations are low. Realistically low to be honest. I understand the originals are rarely as great as people remember them, but while I don't expect much, I am genuinely hoping I am wrong about it. I'd love to be pleasantly surprised. I am also psyched to play it as it was intended with its original MP mechanics. I would also like to see if I can make heads or tails of the story because all I remember is a convoluted time loop. We'll have to see.
